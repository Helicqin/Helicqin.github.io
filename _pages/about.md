I'm Keqing, currently working at Meituan LLM Team. My professional experience includes reasoning models(like o1), mixture of experts(MOE) and LLM alignment. Before that, I also participate in dialogue systems, including end2end dialogue system and dialogue pretrain. 

My research interests focus on LLM, including:
* complex reasoning: Complex reasoning abilities are a key milestone in the development of LLMs, and the rise of reasoning models has rapidly advanced the field. My focus is on the evolution of foundational models and the optimization of Long-COT RL. For reasoning models, we need to build new technical pipelines—innovating from pre-training to post-training, from data to algorithms—to push the boundaries of what's possible.
* reinforcement learning in real-world settings: While LLMs have made impressive strides in reasoning tasks like code and math, they’ve yet to translate into real-world productivity. LLM-driven end-to-end agent systems — such as DeepResearch, GUI Agent, and Embodied Agent — offer an exciting and imaginative path forward. My core interest lies in reinforcement learning in real-world settings, pushing the limits of intelligence through interaction with dynamic environments.
* LLM alignment: Alignment is an essential process when working with LLMs to ensure that models align with human values. My primary focus is on scalable alignment learning, including data evaluation and optimization, as well as preference learning algorithms. This work is crucial for shaping models that are not only powerful but also ethically sound and aligned with our goals.
